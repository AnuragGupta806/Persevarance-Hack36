**A great way to learn**

Hackathon Hack-36 4.0 project titled Edu-Mantra multi functional educational webapp built by our team 'Persevarance' organised by MNNIT-A . We believe that this turned out to be a great opportunity and fun to learn in team.  So here is our attempt .

In this project, we were able to work upon the login and Authentication system and also Live Chatting feature that uses Web Sockets and Asynchronous Request to send messages between students and teachers.

We also tried to implement assignment creation and submission but were stuck on some bugs.  

We also planned to add other useful features like OCR for assignment to change handwritten into word format.
